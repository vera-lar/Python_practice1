lists and tuple in python are both fundamental sequence types in python.but they have key different :
MUTABILITY 
lists is mutable ...meaning thier elements can be change or reassign after creation(add,remove and modify) while Tuples is immutable it can't be (add, remove or modify )after creation.

SYNTAX
lists can be defines using squares bracket [] , while tuples can be define using parentheses ()

PERFORMANCE
tuples are generally more memory-efficient and faster than lists due to their immutability

USES CASES
lists are suitable for collections that need to be modified , such as  storing a sequences of events or a shopping cart.Tuples are suitable for fixed data, such as representing coordinates or databases records 

HOMOGENEITY
lists are use for homogeneous data (same data types ) while tuples are typically used heterogenous(different data types )
